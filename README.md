# Simplest Game Ever

The title says it all.

Navigate the green box around the arena avoiding the other colored, moving boxes. The white rectangles are impassible walls, and the red box is the exit.

You can generate infinite, varying levels with `SimplestGameEver/scripts/level_generator.py`.

```python
cd SimplestGameEver
mkdir levels
# To create 10 levels
python scripts/level_generator.py 10
```
The first level will always remain the same because it's hand-designed. (Hint: The exit is invisible)
